challenging myself
since the challenge requires 3-4 files in a folder i decided to include an html input. the code in test2.js would not work because the src script in html file is connected to test1.js perhaps if you change the src to test2.js you will see your code working
i used the html input button to see if the code is working by typing  a number in the input and get alerted when you click the submit button. i decided not to use console.log. because i was well pleased with this method and the information we are collecting is the users input.
